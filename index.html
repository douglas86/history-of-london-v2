              In the 19th century, a horse-bus or omnibus served as a
              significant means of passenger transportation in both the United
              States and Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
              These large horse-drawn carriages had an enclosed cabin for
              passengers, while the driver usually sat on a front-facing bench,
              positioned outside and at an elevated level.
            </p>
            <p>
              This setup allowed for efficient transport of people across
              various routes.

                1662—The Omnibus was first introduced in Paris, marking a
                significant milestone in public transportation.
              </p>
              <p>
                1677—After 15 years, the Omnibus service was discontinued due to
                increasing fare prices, and it became exclusive to high-society
                members.
              </p>
              <p>
                John Greenwood launched Manchester's first bus line, which
                didn't require any pre-bookings, making it more accessible to
                the public.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1827, Stanislas Baudry commissioned George Shillibeer, an
                English coach maker, to design a carriage capable of carrying a
                large number of customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 28th April 1828, George Shillibeer's successful design became
                the first omnibus in Paris, operating between La Madeleine and
                la Bastille at 15-minute intervals.
              </p>
              <p>
                London introduced its first omnibus in 1831, providing a new
                mode of public transportation.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1833, legislation was passed in London, allowing these
                omnibuses to operate on the streets legally.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thomas Tilling initiated horse bus services in 1850, but they
                faced challenges due to the limitations of horses, such as
                working hours, housing, grooming, feeding, and waste management.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1855, the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) was
                established to regulate horse-drawn omnibus services across the
                city. These systems required multiple horses per bus, leading to
                large stables for each bus system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Around 1860, the advent of mass-produced steel facilitated the
                transition from horse-drawn to rail-based transportation,
                enabling a significant increase in passenger capacity.
              </p>
              <p>
                By 1890, electric propulsion began to replace horse-drawn carts
                in major cities, further advancing public transportation.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 4th August 1914, the last horse-drawn cart service between
                Peckham and Honor Oak Tavern came to an end, marking the end of
                an era in urban transportation.
